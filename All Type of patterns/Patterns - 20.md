**Longest Common Substring:**

Use this technique to find the optimal part of a string/sequence or set of strings/sequences.

**DS Involved**: Array, HashTable

Certainly! Here are more sample problems that involve the Longest Common Substring technique along with brief descriptions:

1. **Longest Common Subsequence**:
   - **Problem**: Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

2. **Longest Repeated Substring**:
   - **Problem**: Given a string s, find the longest substring that occurs at least twice. If no such substring exists, return an empty string "".

3. **Longest Palindromic Substring**:
   - **Problem**: Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.

4. **Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence** (Your sample):
   - **Problem**: Given an array of n positive integers, find the sum of the maximum sum subsequence of the given array such that the integers in the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.

5. **Edit Distance** (Your sample):
   - **Problem**: Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2. You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
     - Insert a character
     - Delete a character
     - Replace a character
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

6. **Longest Common Subarray**:
   - **Problem**: Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return the maximum length of a subarray that appears in both arrays.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-repeated-subarray/)

7. **Longest Common Prefix**:
   - **Problem**: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)

8. **Shortest Common Supersequence**:
   - **Problem**: Given two strings str1 and str2, return the shortest string that has both str1 and str2 as subsequences. If multiple answers exist, you may return any of them.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-common-supersequence/)

These problems demonstrate the application of the Longest Common Substring technique in finding optimal parts of strings or sequences.
