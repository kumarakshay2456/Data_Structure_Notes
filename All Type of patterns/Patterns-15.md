**K-way Merge**:
technique helps us solve problems that involve a list of sorted arrays.

**DS Involved:** Array, Queue, Heap

Certainly! Here are more sample problems that utilize the "K-way Merge" technique along with brief descriptions:

1. **Merge K Sorted Lists**:
   - **Problem**: Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list.

2. **Kth Smallest Number in M Sorted Lists** :
   - **Problem**: Given M sorted lists of varying lengths, find the Kth smallest number among all the arrays.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/)

3. **Kth Smallest Number in a Sorted Matrix** :
   - **Problem**: Given an n x n matrix where each row and column is sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix.

4. **Merge Sorted Array**:
   - **Problem**: Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

5. **Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums**:
   - **Problem**: You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 sorted in ascending order and an integer k. Define a pair (u, v) which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array. Find the k pairs (u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (uk, vk) with the smallest sums.

7. **Find Median from Data Stream**:
   - **Problem**: Design a class to find the median of a stream of integers. The class should have a method addNum(int num) which adds the integer to the data structure and returns the median of the current data stream.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/)

8. **Find Common Elements in N Sorted Arrays**:
   - **Problem**: Given N sorted arrays, find their common elements.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-common-elements-three-sorted-arrays/)

These problems demonstrate the application of the "K-way Merge" technique in efficiently merging and processing multiple sorted arrays.
