**Two Heaps**:
**Usage:** In many problems, we are given a set of elements that can be divided into two parts. We are interested in knowing the smallest element in one part and the biggest element in the other part. As the name suggests, this technique uses a Min-Heap to find the smallest element and a Max-Heap to find the biggest element

**DS Involved:** Heap, Array

Certainly! Here are some sample problems that utilize the "Two Heaps" technique along with brief descriptions:

1. **Find the Median of a Number Stream**:
   - **Problem**: Design a data structure that supports adding integers to a data stream and finding the median of the elements in real-time as they are added.

2. **Next Interval**:
   - **Problem**: Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an interval j whose start point is bigger than or equal to the end point of the interval i, which can be called that j is on the "right" of i. Find the minimum interval j (if any) from the remaining intervals.
