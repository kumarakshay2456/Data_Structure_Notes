**0/1 Knapsack**:
Technique is used to solve optimization problems. Use this technique to select elements that give maximum profit from a given set with a limitation on capacity and that each element can only be picked once.


**DS Involved:** Array, HashTable

**Samples**:

1. **Subset Sum**:
   - **Problem**: Given a set of positive numbers and a target sum, determine if any subset of the numbers can sum up to the target sum.

2. **Equal Subset Sum Partition** :
   - **Problem**: Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

3. **Minimum Subset Sum Difference** :
   - **Problem**: Given a set of positive integers, divide the set into two subsets such that the difference between the sum of elements in both subsets is minimized.

4. **Target Sum**:
   - **Problem**: You are given an integer array nums and an integer target. You want to build an expression out of nums by adding one of the symbols '+' and '-' before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers. Find the total number of different expressions that you can build, which evaluates to target.

5. **Partition Equal Subset Sum**:
   - **Problem**: Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

6. **Count of Subset Sum**:
   - **Problem**: Given an array nums of positive integers, return the number of possible subsets that have a sum equal to a target value k.

7. **Last Stone Weight II**:
   - **Problem**: You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone. We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:
     - If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
     - If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has a new weight y - x.
