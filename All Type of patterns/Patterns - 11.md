10. **Unique Paths III**:
   - **Problem**: On a 2-dimensional grid, there are 4 types of squares:
     - 1 represents the starting square.
     - 2 represents the ending square.
     - 0 represents empty squares we can walk over.
     - -1 represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.
     - Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.
