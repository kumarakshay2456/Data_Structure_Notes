**Samples:** 

Certainly! The Merge Intervals technique is a powerful approach commonly used to deal with overlapping intervals. Here are more sample examples where this technique can be applied:

1. **Overlapping Intervals in Employee Shift Scheduling**: In a company, employees have different shifts, and sometimes these shifts can overlap. You can use the Merge Intervals technique to efficiently schedule employees without any overlap.

2. **Resource Allocation in Project Management**: When managing projects, resources such as meeting rooms, equipment, or personnel may be required for specific time intervals. Merge Intervals can be used to ensure efficient allocation of resources without conflicts.

3. **Flight Scheduling for Airlines**: Airlines need to schedule flights efficiently, considering factors such as runway availability, gate slots, and air traffic control restrictions. Merge Intervals can help optimize flight schedules and avoid overlaps in runway usage.

4. **Hotel Room Booking System**: In a hotel booking system, guests book rooms for certain time intervals. Merge Intervals can be applied to manage room availability and prevent double bookings.

5. **Traffic Management in Smart Cities**: In a smart city, traffic signals at intersections may need to be synchronized to optimize traffic flow. Merge Intervals can assist in determining the optimal timing for traffic signal changes, taking into account the flow of vehicles from different directions.

	**Consider an example scenario of scheduling rooms for academic lectures in a university:**
	
	**Example**: 
	Suppose a university has multiple lecture halls, and professors need to schedule their lectures. Each lecture has a start time and an end time, and it's important to avoid overlapping lectures in the same lecture hall.
	
	Let's say we have the following lecture schedule:
	
	- Lecture 1: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM (Hall A)
	- Lecture 2: 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM (Hall B)
	- Lecture 3: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM (Hall A)
	- Lecture 4: 10:30 AM - 11:30 AM (Hall B)
	
	Using the Merge Intervals technique, we can merge overlapping intervals to schedule lectures efficiently:
	
	Merged Intervals:
	- Lecture 1: 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM (Hall A)
	- Lecture 2: 9:30 AM - 11:30 AM (Hall B)
	
	This ensures that no two lectures are scheduled in the same lecture hall at overlapping times, optimizing the use of available resources.


6. **Conflicting Appointments**
	**Example**: 
	Consider a scenario where you have a list of appointments, each with a start time and an end time. You want to find if there are any conflicting appointments using the Merge Intervals technique.
	
	Let's say we have the following appointments:
	
	- Appointment 1: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM
	- Appointment 2: 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM
	- Appointment 3: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
	- Appointment 4: 10:30 AM - 11:30 AM
	
	Using the Merge Intervals technique, we can merge overlapping intervals to identify conflicting appointments:
	
	Merged Intervals:
	- Appointment 1: 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM
	- Appointment 2: 9:30 AM - 11:30 AM
	
	This indicates that there is a conflict between Appointment 1 and Appointment 2, as they overlap from 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM. Similarly, Appointment 3 and Appointment 4 also overlap, but they don't conflict with any other appointments.



8. **Minimum Meeting Rooms**

	**Example**:
	Suppose you're managing meeting rooms in an office, and multiple meetings are scheduled throughout the day. Each meeting has a start time and an end time, and you want to determine the minimum number of meeting rooms required to accommodate all the meetings without any overlaps.
	
	Let's say we have the following meetings scheduled:
	
	- Meeting 1: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM
	- Meeting 2: 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM
	- Meeting 3: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
	- Meeting 4: 10:30 AM - 11:30 AM
	
	Using the Merge Intervals technique, we can merge overlapping intervals to determine the minimum number of meeting rooms required:
	
	Merged Intervals:
	- Meeting 1: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM
	- Meeting 2: 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM
	- Meeting 3: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
	- Meeting 4: 10:30 AM - 11:30 AM
	
	In this case, all meetings are overlapping, indicating that each meeting needs its own meeting room. Therefore, the minimum number of meeting rooms required is 4.
