**Modified Binary Search**:
Use this technique to search a sorted set of elements efficiently.

**DS Involved:** Array

Certainly! Here are more sample problems that utilize the "Modified Binary Search" technique along with brief descriptions:

1. **Floor of a Number**:
   - **Problem**: Given an array of sorted numbers and a target number, find the floor of the target number. The floor of the target number is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to the target number.

2. **Rotated Sorted Array Search**:
   - **Problem**: Given a sorted array of integers that has been rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand, write a function to search for a target value in the array.

4. **Search in a Sorted Infinite Array**:
   - **Problem**: Given a sorted array of unknown length and a target value, return the index of the target value in the array. If the target is not found, return -1.

5. **Arranging Coins**:
   - **Problem**: You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins. Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

6. **Search Insert Position**:
   - **Problem**: Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index where the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

7. **Peak Index in a Mountain Array**:
   - **Problem**: Let's call an array arr a mountain if the following properties hold:
     - arr.length >= 3
     - There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
       - arr[0] < arr[1] < ... arr[i-1] < arr[i]
       - arr[i] > arr[i+1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/)

8. **Split Array Largest Sum**:
   - **Problem**: Given an array nums which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, partition the array into m non-empty contiguous subarrays. Minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/)
  
9. **Ceiling of a Number**:
   - **Problem**: Given an array of sorted numbers and a target number, find the smallest number in the array which is greater than or equal to the target number.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/)

10. **Bitonic Array Maximum**:
   - **Problem**: Given a bitonic sequence, find the maximum element in it. A bitonic sequence is a sequence that first increases and then decreases.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-maximum-element-in-an-array-which-is-first-increasing-and-then-decreasing/)

These are great examples showcasing the "Modified Binary Search" technique for efficiently searching and finding elements in sorted arrays.
