**Fibonacci Numbers**:
Use this technique to solve problems that follow the Fibonacci numbers sequence, i.e., every subsequent number is calculated from the last few numbers.

**DS Involved:** Array, HashTable

**Samples** :

1. **Climbing Stairs**:
   - **Problem**: You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

2. **House Thief** :
   - **Problem**: You are a professional thief planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. The only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. Determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

3. **N-th Tribonacci Number**:
   - **Problem**: The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows: 
     - T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.
     - Given n, return the value of Tn.

4. **Climbing Stairs with Variable Steps**:
   - **Problem**: You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can climb either 1, 2, or k steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
