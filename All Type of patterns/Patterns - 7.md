**In-place Reversal of a LinkedList**

**Usage:** This technique describes an efficient way to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a LinkedList. Often, the constraint is that we need to do this in-place, i.e., using the existing node objects and without using extra memory.

**DS Involved:** LinkedList

**Sample Problems:**

1. **Reverse every K-element Sub-list**: Given a LinkedList and an integer k, reverse every consecutive k nodes of the LinkedList.

2. **Rotate a LinkedList**: Given a LinkedList and an integer k, rotate the LinkedList to the right by k places.

9. **Add Two Numbers Represented by LinkedLists**: Given two non-empty LinkedLists representing two non-negative integers, add the two numbers and return the sum as a LinkedList.

10. **Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List**: Flatten a multilevel doubly linked list. Each node has a child linked list. Flatten the linked list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list.

These problems showcase various scenarios where the "In-place Reversal of a LinkedList" technique can be applied to efficiently manipulate LinkedLists without using extra memory.
