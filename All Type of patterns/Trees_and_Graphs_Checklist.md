## 1. EASY LEVEL
> Focus on fundamental traversal patterns, simple property checks, and direct implementations.

### Trees (Easy)
- [ ] Inorder / Preorder / Postorder traversals (recursive & iterative)  
- [ ] Level order traversal (BFS)  
- [ ] Maximum depth / height of binary tree  
- [ ] Check if two trees are identical  
- [ ] Symmetric tree check  
- [ ] Search in BST  
- [ ] Insert into BST  
- [ ] Find minimum & maximum in BST  

### Graphs (Easy)
- [ ] BFS traversal of a graph  
- [ ] DFS traversal of a graph  
- [ ] Shortest path in unweighted graph (BFS)  
- [ ] Count connected components in undirected graph  
- [ ] Detect cycle in undirected graph (DFS/BFS)  
- [ ] Number of islands (grid DFS/BFS)

- [ ] Boundary traversal of a binary tree  
- [ ] Flatten binary tree to linked list  
- [ ] Convert sorted array to BST  

### Graphs (Medium)
