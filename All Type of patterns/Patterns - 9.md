**Depth First Search**

**Usage:** This technique is used to solve problems involving traversing trees or graphs in a depth-first search manner.

**DS Involved:** Tree, Graph, Matrix

**Sample Problems**:
1. **Path With Given Sequence**:
   - **Problem**: Given a binary tree and a sequence, determine if the sequence is present as a root-to-leaf path in the tree.

2. **Count Paths for a Sum**:
   - **Problem**: Given a binary tree and a sum, find the total number of paths that sum up to the given sum.

3. **Word Search**:
   - **Problem**: Given a 2D board of letters and a word, determine if the word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where "adjacent" cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring.

4. **Number of Islands**:
   - **Problem**: Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

5. **All Paths From Source to Target**:
   - **Problem**: Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes, find all possible paths from node 0 to node n-1, and return them in any order.

6. **Is Graph Bipartite?**:
   - **Problem**: Given an undirected graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite. A graph is bipartite if we can split its set of nodes into two independent subsets such that every edge connects a node in one subset with a node in the other subset.
