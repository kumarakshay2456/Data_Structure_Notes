**Topological Sort**:
technique to find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on each other.

**DS Involved:** Array, HashTable, Queue, Graph

Samples:

1. **Course Schedule**:
   - **Problem**: There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai. Return true if you can finish all courses, or false otherwise.

2. **Course Schedule II**:
   - **Problem**: There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai. Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

3. **Alien Dictionary** :
   - **Problem**: There is a new alien language that uses the English alphabet. However, the order among the letters is unknown to you. You are given a list of strings words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. Derive the order of letters in this language.

4. **Sequence Reconstruction**:
   - **Problem**: Check whether the original sequence org can be uniquely reconstructed from the sequences in seqs. The org sequence is a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 104. Reconstruction means building a shortest common supersequence of the sequences in seqs (i.e., a shortest sequence so that all sequences in seqs are subsequences of it). Determine whether there is only one sequence that can be reconstructed from seqs and it is the org sequence.

5. **Minimum Height Trees**:
   - **Problem**: A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In this problem, you are given a tree with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree. Return the minimum height of the tree.

6. **All Topological Sorts**:
   - **Problem**: Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with n vertices and m edges, find all possible topological orderings of the vertices.

7. **Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix**:
   - **Problem**: Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.

8. **Reconstruct Itinerary**:
   - **Problem**: Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from "JFK", thus, the itinerary must begin with "JFK".

9. **Tasks Scheduling** :
   - **Problem**: There are a total of numTasks tasks you have to complete, labeled from 0 to numTasks - 1. Some tasks may have prerequisites that need to be completed before others can be started. You are given a list of prerequisite pairs prerequisites, where each pair [ai, bi] indicates that task ai must be completed before task bi can be started. Return true if it is possible to finish all tasks; otherwise, return false.
