**Breadth-First Search**

**Usage:** This technique is used to solve problems involving traversing trees or graphs in a breadth-first search manner.


**DS Involved:** Tree, Graph, Matrix, Queue

Sure! The Breadth-First Search (BFS) technique is commonly used to solve problems involving traversing trees or graphs in a breadth-first manner. Here are the provided examples along with additional ones:

1. **Binary Tree Level Order Traversal**: Traverse a binary tree in level order, i.e., visit all nodes of the same depth before visiting nodes at the next level.

2. **Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree**: Find the minimum depth of a binary tree, which is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

3. **Connect Level Order Siblings**: Connect each node of a binary tree to its next right sibling.

4. **Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal**: Traverse a binary tree in a zigzag pattern, alternating between left-to-right and right-to-left at each level.

5. **Word Ladder**: Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that only one letter can be changed at a time and each transformed word must exist in the word list.

7. **Rotten Oranges**: Given a grid representing a field of apples and oranges, where each cell contains either a 0, 1, or 2, where:
   - 0 represents an empty cell,
   - 1 represents a fresh orange, and
   - 2 represents a rotten orange.
   Determine the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.

8. **Island Count**: Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

9. **Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination**: Given a grid where each cell can either be empty (0) or contain an obstacle (1), find the shortest path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid, where you can eliminate at most k obstacles.

10. **Perfect Squares**: Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.
