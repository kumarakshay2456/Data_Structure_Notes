**Top ‘K’ Elements**:
**Usage:** This technique is used to find top/smallest/frequently occurring ‘K’ elements in a set.

**DS Involved:** Array, Heap, Queue


**Sample Problems:**
Certainly! Here are more sample problems that utilize the "Top 'K' Elements" technique along with brief descriptions:

1. **Top K Frequent Elements**:
   - **Problem**: Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

2. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**:
   - **Problem**: Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

3. **Sliding Window Maximum**:
   - **Problem**: Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Return the maximum sliding window.

7. **Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix**:
   - **Problem**: Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, return the kth smallest element in the matrix.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/)

8. **Kth Largest Element in a Stream**:
   - **Problem**: Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/)

These problems demonstrate the application of the "Top 'K' Elements" technique in finding top, smallest, or frequently occurring 'K' elements efficiently from a set.
