**Bitwise XOR**: technique uses the XOR operator to manipulate bits to solve problems

**DS Involved:** Array, Bits

**Samples:**

1. **Single Number**:
   - **Problem**: Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

4. **Find All Duplicates in an Array**:
   - **Problem**: Given an array of integers nums, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once. Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

5. **Flipping an Image**:
   - **Problem**: Given a binary matrix A, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

6. **Single Number II**:
   - **Problem**: Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)

7. **Decode XORed Array**:
   - **Problem**: There is a hidden integer array arr that consists of n non-negative integers. It was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n - 1, such that encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]. Given the encoded array and an integer first that is the first element of arr, reconstruct the original array arr and return it.

8. **Maximum XOR with an Element from Array**:
   - **Problem**: You are given an array nums consisting of non-negative integers. You are also given a queries array, where queries[i] = [xi, mi]. The answer to the i-th query is the maximum bitwise XOR value of xi and any element of nums that does not exceed mi. In other words, return the maximum xi XOR mi for all xi and mi pairs. Note that xi represents the current query and mi represents the maximum element in the array nums that you can use.

9. **Two Single Numbers**:
   - **Problem**: Given an array of numbers where every number occurs twice except for two numbers which occur only once, find the two numbers that occur only once.
   - **Solution**: [Link to solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)

10. **Invert an Image**:
   - **Problem**: Given a binary matrix A, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.
