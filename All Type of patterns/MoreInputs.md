To comprehensively prepare for DSA interview rounds, you should focus on a wide range of problem types. Here are some additional best practice questions across various categories to enhance your preparation:

### Arrays and Strings
1. **Find the Duplicate Number**: Given an array containing n+1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive.
2. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
3. **Container With Most Water**: Given n non-negative integers representing the heights of a set of vertical lines.

### Linked Lists
4. **Add Two Numbers**: Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
5. **Copy List with Random Pointer**: A linked list where each node has a random pointer.
6. **LRU Cache**: Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

### Trees and Graphs
7. **Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree**: Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor of two given nodes.
8. **Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree**: Implement algorithms to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.
9. **Word Ladder**: Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list.

### Dynamic Programming
10. **Climbing Stairs**: Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. How many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
11. **Coin Change**: Given a set of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount.
12. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**: Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array.

### Greedy Algorithms
13. **Job Sequencing Problem**: Given a set of jobs where each job has a deadline and profit associated with it.
14. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value.

### Backtracking
15. **N-Queens**: Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
16. **Sudoku Solver**: Solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.

### Recursion
17. **Generate Parentheses**: Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.
18. **Permutations**: Given a collection of distinct integers, return all possible permutations.

### Bit Manipulation
19. **Counting Bits**: Given a non-negative integer number, count the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number in the range 0 to n.
20. **Single Number II**: Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once.

### Additional Resources
- **LeetCode**: Offers extensive problems with varying difficulty levels.
- **HackerRank**: Provides practice problems and contests.
- **GeeksforGeeks**: Contains detailed explanations and a large repository of problems.

Focus on understanding the core concepts, practicing problems regularly, and reviewing solutions to gain a thorough understanding of different problem-solving techniques. Good luck with your interview preparation!
